Image Classification Android App
This Android app utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model to perform image classification. Users can either choose an image from the gallery or capture one using the device's camera. The app then processes the image and predicts its class based on the trained model.
Features
•	Choose an image from the gallery for classification.
•	Capture an image using the device's camera for classification.
•	Display the predicted class and additional information about it.
